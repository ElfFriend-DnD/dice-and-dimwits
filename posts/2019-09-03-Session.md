After a brief wait, the Drow and its Bugbear companions walked into the waiting party ambush. The party concealed themselves well and spread out. Springing the trap, the party quickly dispatched the Drow's companions, but knocked him out for further questioning after the battle.

Searching the bodies revealed little of value, but the Drow had a masterfully crafted Flame Tounge Rapier on him that Kronk happily took control of. The Drow was also carrying Gundren's map, this was secured as well by the party.

A few bizzare things happened in the fight with the Drow. When it was knocked unconscious, its form flickered for the time it takes to blink. Hada being the closest saw a blue-skinned humanoid figure with grotesque features in place of the Drow for just a split second before the form reverted to the Drow one.

Although the Drow looks as though it is carrying a lot of the gear an adventurer would be expected to carry, removing any of it from the Drow's body caused it to immediately morph into a bizzarely amorphous blue goo.

The party settled down to wait until the Drow regained consciousness, in hopes that it knows something about Gundren's whereabouts, or the happenings of the last few days. Or really any information at all...
