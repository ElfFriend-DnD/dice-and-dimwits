      <h1>Townriddle&#39;s Bane</h1>

<p>In a confusing whirlwind of combat, Sir Townriddle, the Driver, and the Butler all seemed to collapse on themselves, forming either a greenish ooze creature that tried to slither away, or a redish puddle on the floor that was definitely not blood.</p>
<p>Kronk opened the Carriage and found a horrifying ooze shape inside. He closed the carriage again.</p>
<p>During the battle, Sir Townriddle and the Carriage drive both did something to Stuu and Hada, giving them a horrible headache.</p>
<p>After a couple of rounds, all of the oozes were dispatched, but Stuu managed to catch one and keep it restrained in a cooking pot.</p>
<p>Townspeople had gathered with the commotion, and Stuu sent for the town elders to be gathered, along with everyone who had talked to Townriddle in the past couple days. Before long, a crowd had gathered with Daren Edermath asking what in hell's name was going on.</p>
<p>Stuu explained that something was very wrong with Townriddle and he definitely wasn't who he said he was. Anyone experiencing headaches should see Sister Garaele, and in the meantime they should gather at Town Hall to figure out what exactly had been going on.</p>
