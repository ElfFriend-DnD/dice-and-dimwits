Somewhere south of Neverwinter along the Sword Coast in Fearun, the Forgotten Realms, a group of adventurers is leading a wagon full of supplies to a frontier town. The Cast at this point:

- Stuu Netherwind, Human Fighter from Thundertree
- Torrfig Smashbang, Dwarf Cleric from Gauntlgrym
- Hada Freeblade, Human Fighter Lordling from now-destroyed Coralin Hill
- Kronk, Halfling Rogue from Phandalin.

Our party was hired 6 or so days ago to bring a wagonload of supplied to the frontier town of Phandalin by Gundren Rockseer and his 2 Brothers. Gundren was excited about 'big things' that will be happening in the town soon, and rode ahead with a member of the Lords Alliance (an organization dedicated to bring law and order to towns) named Sildar Hallwinter.
