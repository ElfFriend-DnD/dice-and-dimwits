Less than a day from Phandalin, Goblins attacked the players and their cart at a site with two dead horses that used to belong to Sildar and Gundren. The only sign of the two of them were bodies being dragged through the brush towards a hideout cave, and an empty mapcase with Gundren's Initials and Insignia on it.

After tracking the goblins, things started to heat up when our party pushed into the dark cave with a stream running out of it to hopefully find their employer. Two torrents of water scattered the party and goblins attacked but were quickly dispatched by flights of arrows and slashing of swords.

The party continued down the warren of passages to find a group of goblins beating an unconscious Sildar Hallwinter, and after dispatching them they took a few wounds and set up to take a long rest in the goblin cave, with hopes that Sildar will have more information for them when he awakens.
