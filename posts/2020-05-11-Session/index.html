      <h1>Telran the Terrible</h1>

<p>A small trove of alchemical substances greeted the party in the tiny lab. One of the tables had a set of alchemical tools set up to do some operation that had long since gone over its allotted time. The party decided it was best not to mess with that setup.</p>
<p>Instead they hustled out the other side of the room and into another tunnel. Rounding the corner, Rovu and Craven saw a Kobold encampment on the far end, with a few kobolds manning crossbows there. Certain the hall was full of traps, the party made a plan.</p>
<p>Craven snuck forward with the intention of disarming as many collapsing ceiling traps as he could while Rovu prepared to cast a Web spell on the kobolds at the end of the hall. No more than 15ft down the tunnel did everything go to hell as <em>CLICK</em> Craven was snapped into the air and suspended there.</p>
<p>The kobolds were startled into action and a fight broke out with several kobolds burrowing out of the walls while the party dealth with the constant hail of bolts from down the hall. Rovu dealt with the crossbows while Craven managed the traps, and in the back the rest of the party handled the new kobold threats with ease.</p>
<p>Rovu's fire broke a support beam down and in the process revealed the hallways above the tunnel they were in. The party were at a crossroads. Northwards the room got colder and several points of light glowed in the gloom. To the southwest the party saw another dull purple light around the corner.</p>
<p>The party flipped a coin and headed northwards. The tunnel opened up into a huge room glistening with minerals along the stalagtites and stalagmites. Several pools of acid lay still in the room. The wall and ceiling above each pool looked held up unsteadily by wooden beams.</p>
<p>Atop a rock in the middle of the northern pool gemstones and coins glistened in the low light. As the party debated whether it was even real, Telran the Black's head rose from the pool, chuckling. The party dispensed with any pleasantries and the fight began.</p>
<p>Telran the Black used the acid pools to move around the room and splash the corrosive substance on the party. His scales were thick and a lot of the party's damage was inneffective. Nundro managed to blind him for a round but not before Thorrfig was ripped into by the dragon's fury.</p>
<p>Kobolds interjected themselves into the fight to make the party's lives difficult from time to time, but ultimately the party focused on the dragon at hand. Finally, Thorrfig used his last ounce of magic to collapse a part of the ceiling on Telran's head, in doing so he crushed the dragon, slumping half out of an acid pool.</p>
<p>The remaining Kobolds fled, terrified by their god's death. The party turned their eyes toward its hoard and were delighted that their efforts had finally paid off.</p>
