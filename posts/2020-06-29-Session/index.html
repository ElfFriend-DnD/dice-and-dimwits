<h2 id="quick-summary%3A">Quick summary: <a class="direct-link" href="#quick-summary%3A">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Returned to the Archives and found it closed. Jirna called for Master Carwyn and the party got antsy. They rushed out against Jirna's wishes and without their guide.</li>
<li>Following a locate object spell, Thorrfig lead the party to a building labeled &quot;Vrizz's Workshop&quot;.</li>
<li>Within the workshop, a security system built around transmuter stones and awakened furniture symied the party's progress.</li>
<li>The party solved the transmutation puzzles to gain access to the creation chamber, where they saw a massive golem staring at a station gibbering about danger.</li>
<li>While attempting to retreive the transmuter's stone near the golem, it became agitated and slowly moving towards the party.</li>
</ul>
