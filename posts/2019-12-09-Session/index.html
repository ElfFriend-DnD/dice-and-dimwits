      <h1>Ransom Delivery and Travel</h1>

<p>Gundren's Ransom is set to be collected on the 19th of Leaffall.</p>
<h3 id="17th-of-leaffall">17th of Leaffall <a class="direct-link" href="#17th-of-leaffall">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Discovered Adabra's Windmill under attack by Manticores. Dispatched manitores and healed Adabra.</li>
<li>Convinced Adabra to come with the party to Phandalin and set up shop at least for the time being. She proceeded to comandeer almost all of the cart's space to fill it with her herbs and ingredients, including 2 bags of &quot;specialty ingredients&quot; which she stowed in the carriage chest.</li>
<li>Traveled to the ruined homestead which is the dead drop location. Adabra talked the. entire. way. there. Nailed a bolt into a wall, tied the ransom and letter requesting a summit four days after Gundren's release. Felt a presence in the ruins, got out of dodge.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Captain Targor Bloodsword,</p>
<p>As the Protectors of Phandalin, we are at a cross roads. We do not want any more harm to come to this town and its people and we would request a summit to come to terms. In 7 days time, meet us at the windmill at the location marked on the attached map during suns’ zenith to discuss. If you do not appear on that day, then we will have our answer.</p>
<p>The Heroes of Pandalin</p>

<ul>
<li>Opted to push southward through the night. Stuu and Droop at the helm, got a little lost in the night and ended up west of intended location. Kronk spied a big fire off to the east of their trail. The smoke from the fire rose high in the sky.</li>

<ul>
<li>Smoke rises from a point to the north, beyond the horizon.</li>
<li>Horses exhausted after 24 hours of journey. Adabra mixed up a stimulant to get them on their feet on the fly. Party opted to wait and have a long rest instead of push the horses.</li>
<li>During the rest, two Ettins came down out of the hills and saw the party. The horses were hitched back up quickly and the stimulant was applied. In the haste to be gone from the ettins, a wagon wheel broke.</li>
<li>At the crossroads from the Triboar Trail to Phandalin, the party split ways with Sildar and Adabra. Thorrfig sent a message to Edermath letting them know to expect the herbalist and Sildar. The cart's wheel was patched enough to get them to Phandalin.</li>
<li>Party set off on foot for the Windmill, hoping to be close enough to Gundren when he is released to be able to aid him. Reached the windmill by the end of the day.</li>
<li>Stuu received a reply from Gnomengarde.</li>

<p>Greetings King Korboz,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your prompt reply. We are currently expanding the town of Phandalin and may have something of great interest to your artificers. We humbly request your (or an emissaries) presence in Phandalin in the near future to address these opportunities, as well as protentional Phandalian / Gnomish cooperation.</p>
<p>If interested please inform of a a timeframe and we will do our absolute best to meet you in town as we also deal with problems in the region. If we are not available when you arrive let Toblin Stonehill at the inn know we will cover all expenses incurred as you wait for our return. Eddermath will be able to give you a better idea of our timeframe for our return and should be able to give you an overview of our current endeavors.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and we look forward to seeing Gnomegarde in the near future.</p>
<p>Stuu, and the heroes of Phandalin</p>

<li>Poked around in the herbalist shop and found little left that wasn't destroyed in the manticore attack. Curiosity was a wooden crate with straw packed into it. Whatever fragile thing used to be here is gone now.</li>
