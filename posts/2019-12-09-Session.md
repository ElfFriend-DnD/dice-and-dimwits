Gundren's Ransom is set to be collected on the 19th of Leaffall.

### 17th of Leaffall
- Discovered Adabra's Windmill under attack by Manticores. Dispatched manitores and healed Adabra.
- Convinced Adabra to come with the party to Phandalin and set up shop at least for the time being. She proceeded to comandeer almost all of the cart's space to fill it with her herbs and ingredients, including 2 bags of "specialty ingredients" which she stowed in the carriage chest.
- Traveled to the ruined homestead which is the dead drop location. Adabra talked the. entire. way. there. Nailed a bolt into a wall, tied the ransom and letter requesting a summit four days after Gundren's release. Felt a presence in the ruins, got out of dodge.

> As the Protectors of Phandalin, we are at a cross roads. We do not want any more harm to come to this town and its people and we would request a summit to come to terms. In 7 days time, meet us at the windmill at the location marked on the attached map during sunsâ€™ zenith to discuss. If you do not appear on that day, then we will have our answer.

### Nightfall 17th of Leaffall
- Opted to push southward through the night. Stuu and Droop at the helm, got a little lost in the night and ended up west of intended location. Kronk spied a big fire off to the east of their trail. The smoke from the fire rose high in the sky.

### 18th of Leaffall
- Smoke rises from a point to the north, beyond the horizon.
- Horses exhausted after 24 hours of journey. Adabra mixed up a stimulant to get them on their feet on the fly. Party opted to wait and have a long rest instead of push the horses. 
- During the rest, two Ettins came down out of the hills and saw the party. The horses were hitched back up quickly and the stimulant was applied. In the haste to be gone from the ettins, a wagon wheel broke.
- At the crossroads from the Triboar Trail to Phandalin, the party split ways with Sildar and Adabra. Thorrfig sent a message to Edermath letting them know to expect the herbalist and Sildar. The cart's wheel was patched enough to get them to Phandalin.
- Party set off on foot for the Windmill, hoping to be close enough to Gundren when he is released to be able to aid him. Reached the windmill by the end of the day.
- Stuu received a reply from Gnomengarde.

### Nightfall 18th of Leaffall
- Poked around in the herbalist shop and found little left that wasn't destroyed in the manticore attack. Curiosity was a wooden crate with straw packed into it. Whatever fragile thing used to be here is gone now.
