      <h1>Longsaddle</h1>

<p>The party started the day by visiting Remington Tower and securely sending enough gold to fully pay off the Rockseer debt by flying homunculous back to Phandalin.</p>
<p>With their coffers significantly lighter, they next visited the Rolling Wheel and bought a number of magical upgrades for their carriage to make travel faster and in general more secure. These upgrades would take 4-5 days to complete.</p>
<p>Next stop, Harpell Mansion, where a massive Sphinx guards the front gate to the estate. It forced them to answer a riddle before it would allow them inside, and Stuu answered correcly a flash of brilliance.</p>
<p>Within the manor the party purchased access to the library for the day and spent the time researching things that they were interested in.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rovu learned the origins of Cragmaw Castle, and found the teachings of an arcane monastic tradition. He committed much of these teachings to memory in short order and found himseslf able to cast the Prestidigitation spell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stuu attempted to take inspiration from some bardic epics in an effort to be more charismatic, and while he learned a lot, it wasn't quite enough to manifest a change in a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thorrfig confirmed much of what he knew about his Cousins' Lost Mines, but the library told him that they didn't have much reading material on the Phandelver's Pact. They informed him of a local researcher by the name of Inventor Vrizz in Gnomengarde who wrote seeking similar information several months ago. Stuu thought this name sounded familiar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craven got a similar response when he looked into the Lost Mines. He also attempted to pry for information regarding the Zhentarim and their history. The library staff were instantly suspicious of him when they heard that name, and informed him that while they have information, it is in the restricted collection that requires an invitation to enter. &quot;If you are familiar with the Way of Silver, that may be a way to secure one such invitation.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After restocking at Lionshield Provisions, the party decided they'd head to Gnomengarde while the carriage was being worked on.</p>
<p>A day and a half of wilderness travel led by Craven later, the party found themselves at the main gate of Gnomengarde.</p>
<p>The massive door was intricately inlaid with mechanisms and magical inscriptions and was gaurded. After explaining that Korboz was expecting them, the gate was opened. Two cats darted out from inside, flustering the gaurdsman who hurried the party inside. In the time it took for the party to enter, another cat darted through their legs out the gate.</p>
<p>The gaurd explained that something seems to have spooked the cats lately. He directed them to see Darina Huba, Korboz's Assistant, at the Palace. She would set the party up with whatever they need in town. Before leaving, they asked about where they might find Inventor Vrizz. &quot;Eh? Inventor Vrizz? Never heard of em. Sorry can't help you there.&quot;</p>
<p>Moving through the gnomish-proportioned underground town, the party was struck by how few people were out and about, given the number of structures visible. It seems like the population of the town would be higher than it is. A dragonchess park was empty, in spite of it being early evening.</p>
<p>Glancing down an alleyway between gnomish-proportioned structures, Craven noticed it was teeming with rats. The rats scattered when Rovu struck one with a Radiant bolt, and there were no obvious reasons why they would congregate. Another gaurd hurried them along towards the palace. &quot;Oi! You biguns ain't got an escort? You need an escort to be out and about.&quot;</p>
<p>Korboz's Assistants' office was human-sized and had two workstations filled with papers. Maps, Patents, Letters, Recipts, etc were piling up and there was a single haggard looking gnomish woman behind one of the desks. After the party identified themselves as the &quot;Heroes of Phandalin,&quot; she waded through papers to get their file out of a cabinet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ah yes here we are. You were looking to commision our artificeries. Let me see here... I ... have no time to help you right now. But I will set up a meeting with each of our three artificeries tomorrow and send a guide to meet you at your guest room at 8:08 am.</p>
<p>One thing to know. The gnomish code of law is exceptionally complex. Too complex to explain to every visitor that arrives, it's almost certain you've already violated it but since you weren't aware at the time we'll overlook it. We find it easier to just assign a guide to every outsider group and make them responsible for ensuring that you don't break gnomish law. Don't travel anywhere without Jirna.</p>
<p>Before I hustle you out, is there anything I can offer recommendations about?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She handed them the key to Suite 13 in the adjoining guesthouse. The party took this opportunity to ask about Inventor Vrizz.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inventor Vrizz? No... I don't know of anyone by that name here, you're sure they're from Gnomengarde? The Harpells sent you after them? That's so wierd. Why would they send you after someone who doesn't exist? A prank maybe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confused and suspicious, the party left the palace and headed to the guesthouse. A thorough sweep of the suite revealed nothing out of the ordinary, and so the party settled down to rest.</p>
