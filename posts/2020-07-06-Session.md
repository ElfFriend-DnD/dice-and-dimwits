## Quick summary:

- Figured out the Golem was most interested in the last source of damage that it took.
- Thorrfig sacrificed a handaxe to the Golem, who destroyed it.
- Opening more doors, the party found more transmuter stones as well as some more animated tools and defenses, including a particularly sassy anvil.
- Vrizz's Office was located and a key to the basement was found. Vrizz also had some [relevant reading material](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MBZpdvihY1NzlxThKtv) out on her desk. The party also pocketed the office treasury.
- Returning to the Basement Door and inserting the key the party descended into a non-descript boiler room that smelled real bad.
- Following their nose, the party discovered a hole in the wall that they somehow missed inspite of it being a huge tunnel.
- The party retreated to rest before exploring the tunnel.
- While resting, the party was attacked by ... something. But remembering it is fuzzy at best.
