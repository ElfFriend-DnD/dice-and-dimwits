<ul>
<li>Figured out the Golem was most interested in the last source of damage that it took.</li>
<li>Thorrfig sacrificed a handaxe to the Golem, who destroyed it.</li>
<li>Opening more doors, the party found more transmuter stones as well as some more animated tools and defenses, including a particularly sassy anvil.</li>
<li>Vrizz's Office was located and a key to the basement was found. Vrizz also had some <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MBZpdvihY1NzlxThKtv">relevant reading material</a> out on her desk. The party also pocketed the office treasury.</li>
<li>Returning to the Basement Door and inserting the key the party descended into a non-descript boiler room that smelled real bad.</li>
<li>Following their nose, the party discovered a hole in the wall that they somehow missed inspite of it being a huge tunnel.</li>
<li>The party retreated to rest before exploring the tunnel.</li>
<li>While resting, the party was attacked by ... something. But remembering it is fuzzy at best.</li>
