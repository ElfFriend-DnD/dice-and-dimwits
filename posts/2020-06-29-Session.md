title: The Fourth Workshop
description: After lunch and letters, the party attempted to return to the archives only to find them closed. Jirna wanted to stay and get them back open but the party wasn't having it, walking out of the palace and out into the town on their own. They followed Thorrfig's locate object spell and found the fourth workshop.

## Quick summary:

- Returned to the Archives and found it closed. Jirna called for Master Carwyn and the party got antsy. They rushed out against Jirna's wishes and without their guide.
- Following a locate object spell, Thorrfig lead the party to a building labeled "Vrizz's Workshop".
- Within the workshop, a security system built around transmuter stones and awakened furniture symied the party's progress.
- The party solved the transmutation puzzles to gain access to the creation chamber, where they saw a massive golem staring at a station gibbering about danger.
- While attempting to retreive the transmuter's stone near the golem, it became agitated and slowly moving towards the party.
