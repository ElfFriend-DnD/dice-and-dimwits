The party loaded up the wagon with their newfound treasures and rolled out northwards. They decided to see if the Wizards of Longsaddle could send some gold to Phandalin, not trusting that they wouldn't spend it all in one place.

One night on the way there, a haunting song reached the party's campsite. They decided to remain extra vigilant against a possible Fey encounter. Tales of mortals accidentally trading more years of their lives than they have rang in the minds of those who heard the song.

About midnight, during Stuu and Craven's watch, the song grew louder as a single beautiful woman clothed in a dress of feathers approached the camp. Stuu's mind raced with unfamiliar emotions. He _had_ to go talk to the woman. He ran out of the camp, footsteps keeping time with the song. Craven kept his head and attempted to stop Stuu but the man was too fast.

Craven yelled and the party woke up, expecting a fight. Each member of the party saw an idealized woman clothed in feathers beconing Stuu onward. Stuu suddenly snapped out of his flight and realized his peril. Rovu darted forward and threw a bead of silence at the woman, cutting the song off.

Silence enveloped the camp. The woman realized her song was thwarted and fled.

In the morning they hastened away from this accursed place. It wasn't long into the day when they reached the road and found it a well traveled and upkept trade route. The Lords' Alliance presence in keeping the trade ways safe was felt here.

At the end of the day a lone bard named Zemmy offered the party food and drink in exchange for stories. The party told him tales of all their exploits and he rewarded them with his undivided attention. But he was a difficult person to please, and demanded more stories from them late into the night. After a particularly frustrated exclamation, his form shifted and revealed that he was in fact a Copper Dragon.

The party pleaded with him, telling him that he was being unreasonable and cruel to them. He realized the error of his ways and apologised profusely.

By the end of the 13th of Uktar, the party arrived at Longsaddle. The village was smaller than they expected and from the looks of things, unprotected. Four arcane towers stood on the eastern side. Asking around, they learned that they should talk to Remington about postal services, and they got the names of a good wagonwright in town.
