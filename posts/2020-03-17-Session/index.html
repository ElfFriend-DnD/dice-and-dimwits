      <h1>Arlidan&#39;s Traveling Troubadors</h1>

<p>Our Party spent the day enjoying the festivities of Arlidan's Traveling Troubadors. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dice were thrown and money was won and lost.</li>
<li>The Goliath Strongman Loroghan Tribevigor Munakukate's Wench Press Challenge was nearly bested by Hada, but the final lift prooved too much for him.</li>
<li>The Gnomish Esteemed Inventor Deppeg sold his Gemwork Crossbow to Stuu after being impressed with the speed and comfort he used it in the arcane archery challenge. He made Stuu promise to talk it up to Master Inventor Vrizz when the party gets to Gnomengarde.</li>
<li>Stuu bested Jedar the Tortle Dragonchess Master.</li>
<li>The Goliath Strongman happily took the money of everyone who wanted to arm wrestle him.</li>
<li>Much food and drink was enjoyed. In particular Hada bought an unopened cask of his family's own wine and proceeded to share it with the festival goers.</li>
<li>The guest acts were enjoyed: The Four Halfling Duelists in Two Trenchcoats, Tabaxi Clever Water's Exotic Animals, Drow Argent Flyers' Flying Trapeze act.</li>
<li>Madam Eva read the Fortunes for each of the party.</li>
<li>At the end of the After-Party, Thorrfig and Rovu heard Arlidan the Bard recount the heroic tale of the Vonidod vs Gedrerth the Gold. The Vonidod was an Adamantine construct of giant proportions used during the Thousand Year War between Giants and Dragons. Its pilot, a Fire Giant named Fedthos, was finally defeated in a Phyrric Victory by Gedrerth in a battle that lasted a week and a day. Their end was so violent it split the earth and created the Dessarin Crags south of Yatar.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the night, after the after-party, the party retired to their suite upstairs. Stuu and Hada were already asleep, but as Thorrfig and Rovu retired they noticed a dark figure rifling through the party's belongings.</p>
<p>A quick spell and rope tie later, they had restrained the figure and seen it was a male Drow, possibly one of the three from the Argent Flyers. Once the spell wore off, the figure escaped Rovu's grasp and, with his hands still tied, dropped a Darkness spell on the room escaping out the window. The party gave chase, using Daylight to dispell the Darkness and jumping out the window after the figure. A vaugely humanoid figure glowing with dim light between two houses north of the Inn drew in the party like moths, and after a moment, disappeared. The Drow was nowhere to be seen. Returning to their room, they found no items missing, but did find a small coin-sized lump of coal that none of them remember seeing before.</p>
